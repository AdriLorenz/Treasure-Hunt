<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Our application called "Ready,Set,Vamos!", was made with MySQL, Node.js and React. It is a meeting app for people who want to go to places in Gran Canaria, where you can decide which type of places you want to go and then some routes will appear for you to decide. It also has a system of points where you earn them by completing routes and then use them as discount in places like restaurants, cinemas ...</p>

<p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.</p>

<p>React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.</p>

<h3>Installation manual</h3>
<p>First go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download the one recommended for most users, then download mysql where you will keep the database (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).</p>
<p>Second, you will have to clone the project into visual studio code (in case you don't have it, download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the command: "git clone https://github.com/AdriLorenz/Treasure-Hunt".</p>
